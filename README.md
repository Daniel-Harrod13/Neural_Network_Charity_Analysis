# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
In this project, we are given a Data CSV that has approximately 34,000 organizations that have recieved funding from the company named Alphabet Soup. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

EIN and NAME—Identification columns

APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type

AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry

CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification

USE_CASE—Use case for funding

ORGANIZATION—Organization type

STATUS—Active status

INCOME_AMT—Income classification

SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application

ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested

IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

### Analysis
Using our tools, we built a Neural Network that creates a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. Provided above is the code we used to create this system, as well asd an optimized version attempting to imrpove accuarcy. The results can be found in the .h5 files.
